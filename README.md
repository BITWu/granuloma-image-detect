# granuloma-image-detect

Matlab code for Granuloma Image Detection using Gabor Wavelet Method for Feature Extraction and Support Vector Machine for Classification.

Dental granuloma appears as total or partial chronic necrotic of the tooth root. In diagnosing this disorder, periapical radiography is needed to observe patient's tooth.

Radiographic image result of granuloma is marked with radiolucent (blackish colour) appearance on the root part of the tooth image, which will be the focus area for the system.

Input for program will be a radiograph image which will produce an output of classification result notification to the user (Granuloma or Non-Granuloma).

Use multiextraction.m and training.m to train program first before main.m (once only).
